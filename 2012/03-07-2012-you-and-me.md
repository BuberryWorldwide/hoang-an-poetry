**You and Me**

Hoàng-Ân


You and Me

Uhm...You are so lovely
You are my heart disease
You are my destiny
You are my fantasies
You are my reveries
You are my memories
Your are my dignity
You are my integrity
You are my honesty
You are my identity
You are my clarity

You are me
You are me
You are me
You and I
We are our unity
You love me
You need me
You want me
You and I:
Our love shall taste eternity
We shall be together everlastingly

...Uhm...You are so lovely
...Uhm...You are so lovingly
